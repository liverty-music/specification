package liverty_music.entity.v1;

// Package liverty_music.entity.v1 provides core business entity definitions for the Liverty Music application.
//
// This package contains fundamental data structures that represent the primary business entities
// (User, Concert, Artist, Venue) and their associated types for identification and validation.
// These entities serve as the foundation for all API operations and data persistence layers.
//
// Key characteristics:
// - All entities use UUID-based identifiers for uniqueness and scalability
// - Domain-specific types encapsulate validation rules using protovalidate
// - Entities reference other entities by identifier to maintain loose coupling
// - All fields include comprehensive validation constraints for data integrity
