## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: BubbleManager supports reset to global top artists
The BubbleManager SHALL provide a reset operation that discards the current bubble field and re-seeds it with the global top artists, keeping pool state and physics state synchronized. The reset SHALL be independent of the user's followed artists and SHALL NOT use the follow-seeded similar-artist path.

#### Scenario: Reset replaces the pool with global top artists
- **WHEN** the reset operation is invoked
- **THEN** the BubbleManager SHALL fetch the global top artists via `listTop(country, '', 50)`
- **AND** SHALL exclude followed artists from the result
- **AND** SHALL replace the entire pool with the deduplicated result capped at the 50-bubble limit

#### Scenario: Reset clears accumulated discovery state
- **WHEN** the reset operation is invoked after similar-artist bubbles have accumulated
- **THEN** the BubbleManager SHALL clear the deduplication seen-sets and re-track only the newly seeded artists
- **AND** SHALL discard prior eviction history so the new field is a clean baseline

#### Scenario: Reset re-synchronizes physics state
- **WHEN** the reset operation completes
- **THEN** the canvas SHALL be reloaded so the rendered physics bodies match the new pool
- **AND** the pool count and physics body count SHALL be equal after reset completes

### Requirement: Initial load tops up a sparse discovery field
When the user already follows artists, the initial load seeds bubbles from those artists' similar artists. Because the similar lists shrink as follow count grows (seeds are capped, the per-seed limit shrinks, and deduplication removes followed and overlapping artists), the BubbleManager SHALL top up the field with global top artists whenever the deduplicated seed-similar results fall below a minimum target. Similar artists SHALL keep priority. This guarantees the field is never empty and stays reasonably full regardless of how many artists the user follows.

#### Scenario: Sparse seed-similar results are topped up
- **WHEN** the initial load takes the similar-seed path and the deduplicated similar results are below the minimum target
- **THEN** the BubbleManager SHALL append global top artists (deduplicated against followed and already-included artists) up to the bubble cap
- **AND** the similar artists SHALL retain priority order ahead of the top-artist fillers

#### Scenario: Empty seed-similar still fills the field
- **WHEN** the similar lookups resolve to nothing (no matches, errors, or all results deduped away)
- **THEN** the BubbleManager SHALL fill the field with global top artists rather than leaving it empty

#### Scenario: Sufficient seed-similar results are not diluted
- **WHEN** the deduplicated similar results meet or exceed the minimum target
- **THEN** the BubbleManager SHALL NOT fetch or append top artists
