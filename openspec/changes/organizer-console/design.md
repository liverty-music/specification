## Context

See proposal.md - Why. Mirrors the admin console pattern (bundle-isolated
entry + dedicated hosting) for the organizer surface. Depends on
`organizer-tenancy` (the `organizer-console` OIDC app + per-tenant
passkey-primary login policy). Full design:
[`docs/organizer-platform-design.md`](../../../docs/organizer-platform-design.md).

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:** a bundle-isolated organizer entry, OIDC login via org-pinned
entry, a role-claim route guard, a placeholder, and the dedicated
hosting.

**Non-Goals:** business screens; the organizer API server
(`organizer-rpc-server`); per-org branding; a reception PWA.

## Decisions

**D1 — One OIDC client, org resolved by org-pinned entry (not domain
discovery).** A single `organizer-console` client serves all tenants; the
operator's org is resolved at login by an **org handle** (`org_id` in the URL
or a remembered `org_id`), which the console turns into the Zitadel
`urn:zitadel:iam:org:id:<orgId>` scope. This is why the organizer
`/config.json` omits a fixed `zitadelOrgId` — baking one in would break the
multi-tenant single-app model. Email-domain discovery was dropped from the MVP
in `organizer-tenancy` (redundant, and useless for consumer/gmail operators);
this console implements the org-pinned path instead. A fresh device with no
remembered `org_id` uses an **invitation link** from the backend provisioner
(see D5).

**D2 — Role-claim route guard, backend is source of truth.** Unlike the admin
console (where Google Workspace login *is* the wall), any tenant-org account
authenticates successfully; the console guard therefore inspects the
`organizer-console` project roles claim and admits only `owner`. Real
enforcement is at the backend; the guard is UX.

**D3 — Dedicated hosting mirrors admin-console-hosting.** `organizer.{base}`
host with HTTPRoute + cert + Cloud DNS + per-host `/config.json`; bundle
isolation is enforced the same way as the admin console (consumer chunk
graph contains no organizer module).

**D4 — Consumer config contract unchanged.** The organizer entry defines its
own config shape (this change); the consumer's `frontend-runtime-config`
requirement governs the consumer SPA only and is not modified.

**D5 — First-time sign-in uses an invitation email + Zitadel's OIDC-embedded
invite flow; `CreatePasskeyRegistrationLink` is NOT used.**
`CreatePasskeyRegistrationLink` (the original approach in organizer-accounts)
generates a bare `passkey/set` URL outside any OIDC context. Its registration
code is single-use even on failure due to upstream bug
[#12499](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/issues/12499) (unfixed as of
Zitadel v4.14.0 — code marked consumed on first click regardless of whether the
passkey ceremony succeeds), making retries impossible and leaving the operator
stranded on a Zitadel error page with no path back to the console.

Verified live (2026-08-21): sending the operator to
`organizer.{base}/?org_id=<tenantOrgId>&login_hint=<email>` initiates a normal
OIDC flow. Zitadel's login v2 detects the uninitialized user (no passkeys
registered in a passwordless-only org) and automatically sends an "Invitation to
Zitadel Login" email (branded as Liverty Music, from our domain). The operator
clicks "Accept invite", completes the passkey ceremony, and Zitadel finalises
the in-flight OIDC auth request, redirecting to `/auth/callback` → `/welcome`.
No dead-end; retries are possible at any step; the `#12499` bug is avoided
entirely because `passkey/set` is never used.

The backend provisioner (organizer-accounts) SHALL therefore:
- remove the `CreatePasskeyRegistrationLink` call, and
- send a custom invitation email (via the existing Postmark notification
  infrastructure) containing the console URL with `?org_id=<id>&login_hint=<email>`.

The `login_hint` is passed through the OIDC authorization request to pre-fill
the operator's email in Zitadel's login page, eliminating one manual input step.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **Shared AppConfig type** → if the organizer entry reuses the consumer
  AppConfig type, `zitadelOrgId` must become optional for the organizer
  variant; keep the consumer's required-org contract intact (implementation
  reconciliation, not a consumer spec change).
- **Bundle-isolation regression** → reuse the admin console's chunk-graph CI
  assertion.

## Migration Plan

1. frontend: `organizer.html` entry (bundle-isolated), OIDC via domain
   discovery, role-claim route guard, placeholder; chunk-graph CI assertion.
2. cloud-provisioning: `organizer.{base}` host (HTTPRoute, cert, Cloud DNS) +
   per-host ConfigMap; add the host to the `organizer-console` OIDC app
   redirect URIs.
- Rollback: additive entry + host; remove with no consumer/admin impact.
