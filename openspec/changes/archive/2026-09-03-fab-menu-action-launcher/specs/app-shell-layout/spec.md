## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: App shell hosts the global FAB action launcher

The app shell SHALL host a single global FAB action launcher (see the
`fab-action-launcher` capability) as a top-layer surface alongside the bottom
navigation bar. The launcher SHALL be a single instance owned by the shell (not
re-created per route). The launcher SHALL be shown only when the bottom navigation
bar is shown; on routes that hide the navigation bar (Landing Page, Auth Callback)
the launcher SHALL NOT be rendered. So the launcher can float clear of the
navigation bar, the shell SHALL make the navigation bar's rendered height available
to the launcher (e.g. as a CSS custom property) rather than relying on a hard-coded
offset.

#### Scenario: Launcher present with the navigation bar

- **WHEN** the app shell renders a route that shows the bottom navigation bar
- **THEN** the shell SHALL render exactly one FAB action launcher instance in the top layer
- **AND** the launcher SHALL be positioned clear of the navigation bar using the navigation bar's published height plus the safe-area inset

#### Scenario: Launcher absent on fullscreen routes

- **WHEN** the user is on the Landing Page or Auth Callback route
- **THEN** the shell SHALL NOT render the FAB action launcher

#### Scenario: Navigation height is published for offset

- **WHEN** the bottom navigation bar is rendered
- **THEN** its rendered height SHALL be exposed to the launcher (e.g. via a CSS custom property on the shell)
- **AND** the launcher's bottom offset SHALL be derived from that height plus the bottom safe-area inset, without a hard-coded pixel constant
