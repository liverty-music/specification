## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Snack text meets WCAG AA contrast

Every snack bar's message and its action label SHALL keep a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against the container colour behind them at every point of the container's gradient, for every severity. This applies to the action's own fill as well: the on-container action's translucent white fill over the gradient. The minimum SHALL be met by the container colours and SHALL NOT depend on the text being large. The brand colours used by other surfaces (the FAB, the navigation bar, the filled button) SHALL NOT change for this.

#### Scenario: Message contrast on every severity
- **WHEN** an info, a warning and an error snack bar are each shown
- **THEN** the white message SHALL measure at least 4.5:1 against every point of that snack's container gradient, both ends included

#### Scenario: Action contrast on every severity
- **WHEN** a snack bar with an action (such as the update snack) is shown in each severity
- **THEN** the action's label SHALL measure at least 4.5:1 against the action's translucent fill laid over every point of the container gradient, both ends included

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Snack Bar Component
The system SHALL provide a `<snack-bar>` custom element (renamed from `<toast-notification>`) that displays transient status messages using the Popover API, with each snack as an independent `popover="manual"` element managed by browser-native entry/exit transitions.

#### Scenario: Snack display on event publish
- **WHEN** a `Snack` event is published via `IEventAggregator`
- **THEN** the component SHALL create a new element with `popover="manual"` attribute
- **AND** the element SHALL be made visible via `showPopover()`
- **AND** the snack SHALL display the event's `message` text and an icon matching the `severity`

#### Scenario: Auto-dismiss after duration
- **WHEN** a snack is displayed
- **THEN** the component SHALL call `hidePopover()` after the snack's `durationMs` (default 2500ms)
- **AND** the CSS exit transition SHALL play before the element is removed from the Top Layer

#### Scenario: Programmatic dismiss via handle
- **WHEN** a caller invokes `snack.handle.dismiss()`
- **THEN** `hidePopover()` SHALL be called immediately
- **AND** the auto-dismiss timer SHALL be cleared
- **AND** the `onDismiss` callback SHALL fire exactly once

#### Scenario: DOM cleanup after exit transition
- **WHEN** a snack's `hidePopover()` triggers and the CSS exit transition completes
- **THEN** the popover's `toggle` event SHALL fire with `newState === 'closed'`
- **AND** the component SHALL remove the snack from its internal array
- **AND** the component SHALL NOT rely on `transitionend` events for cleanup

#### Scenario: Multiple simultaneous snacks
- **WHEN** multiple `Snack` events are published in rapid succession
- **THEN** each snack SHALL be an independent popover element in the Top Layer
- **AND** dismissing one snack SHALL NOT interfere with other snacks' transitions or lifecycle
- **AND** snacks SHALL stack vertically in a flex-column layout container

#### Scenario: Snack action button
- **WHEN** a `Snack` event includes an `action` option with `label` and `callback`
- **THEN** the snack SHALL display an action button with the given label
- **AND** clicking the button SHALL invoke the callback and dismiss the snack

#### Scenario: Reduced motion preference
- **WHEN** `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is active
- **THEN** the snack SHALL still be dismissed and removed correctly
- **AND** a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` CSS rule SHALL set `transition-duration: 0s` on `.snack-item` to suppress animation

#### Scenario: CSS entry animation
- **WHEN** a snack popover is opened via `showPopover()`
- **THEN** the snack SHALL rise into place from below, animating from `opacity: 0; transform: translateY(1rem)` to `opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0)`
- **AND** the entry state SHALL be defined via `@starting-style` inside `:popover-open`

#### Scenario: CSS exit animation
- **WHEN** a snack popover is closed via `hidePopover()`
- **THEN** the snack SHALL sink out of place, animating from `opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0)` to `opacity: 0; transform: translateY(1rem)`
- **AND** the transition SHALL include `display allow-discrete` and `overlay allow-discrete` to keep the element visible in the Top Layer until the animation completes

#### Scenario: Snack severity visual variants
- **WHEN** a snack has severity `info`
- **THEN** the background SHALL use a gradient in the brand hues (from brand-primary's hue to brand-secondary's), darkened so that white text meets 4.5:1 across it
- **WHEN** a snack has severity `warning`
- **THEN** the background SHALL use a deep amber gradient, dark enough that white text meets 4.5:1 across it
- **WHEN** a snack has severity `error`
- **THEN** the background SHALL use a deep red gradient

#### Scenario: Accessibility
- **WHEN** a snack is displayed
- **THEN** the snack element SHALL have `role="status"` for screen reader announcement
- **AND** the snack SHALL be non-modal (SHALL NOT make background content inert)

#### Scenario: Top Layer stacking with dialogs
- **WHEN** a snack is shown while a `<dialog>` is open via `showModal()`
- **THEN** the snack popover SHALL appear above the dialog because `showPopover()` appends to the top of the Top Layer stack
- **AND** no manual `hidePopover()`/`showPopover()` re-insertion SHALL be needed
