## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Backend prod images SHALL be promoted to prod AR on GitHub Release tags

The backend `deploy.yml` workflow SHALL publish to `liverty-music-prod/backend/{server,consumer,concert-discovery,artist-image-sync}` Artifact Registry only when triggered by a published GitHub Release. On the release path, for each of the 4 images in the workflow's strategy matrix, the workflow SHALL **promote the dev AR image via cross-repository copy** rather than rebuild — it resolves the dev AR digest for `<image-name>:${GITHUB_SHA}`, then invokes `crane copy` (from `google/go-containerregistry`, installed via `imjasonh/setup-crane`) twice to copy that exact digest to `liverty-music-prod/backend/<image-name>:<release-tag>` and `:<sha>`. No `docker build` SHALL run on the release path. The existing dev path (push-to-`main` → push to `liverty-music-dev/backend/<image-name>:latest,:main,:<sha>`) SHALL be preserved unchanged. This ensures prod runs byte-identical bytes to dev for every backend image: the digests tested in dev are the digests deployed to prod.

> **Renamed from**: "Backend prod image build SHALL be triggered by GitHub Release tags". The rename is part of the rebuild-to-retag flip.

#### Scenario: Push to main triggers dev-only backend build

- **WHEN** a commit is pushed to `liverty-music/backend:main`
- **THEN** the `deploy.yml` workflow SHALL push images only to `liverty-music-dev/backend/{server,consumer,concert-discovery,artist-image-sync}`
- **AND** SHALL NOT push to `liverty-music-prod/backend/*`

#### Scenario: GitHub Release publish promotes the 4 dev AR digests

- **WHEN** a GitHub Release is published in `liverty-music/backend` with tag `vX.Y.Z`
- **THEN** the workflow SHALL NOT invoke `docker build` or `docker/build-push-action` on the release path for any of the 4 matrix entries
- **AND** for each `<image-name>` in `{server, consumer, concert-discovery, artist-image-sync}` the workflow SHALL resolve the dev AR digest for `asia-northeast2-docker.pkg.dev/liverty-music-dev/backend/<image-name>:${GITHUB_SHA}` via `gcloud artifacts docker images describe`
- **AND** for each `<image-name>` the workflow SHALL run `crane copy asia-northeast2-docker.pkg.dev/liverty-music-dev/backend/<image-name>@<digest> asia-northeast2-docker.pkg.dev/liverty-music-prod/backend/<image-name>:vX.Y.Z`
- **AND** for each `<image-name>` the workflow SHALL run `crane copy asia-northeast2-docker.pkg.dev/liverty-music-dev/backend/<image-name>@<digest> asia-northeast2-docker.pkg.dev/liverty-music-prod/backend/<image-name>:${GITHUB_SHA}`
- **AND** the workflow SHALL invoke `gcloud auth configure-docker asia-northeast2-docker.pkg.dev` before the copy steps (in every matrix entry) so `crane`'s authentication (which reads `~/.docker/config.json` credential helpers, not `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` directly) resolves to the prod CI service account's WIF token

#### Scenario: Prod and dev backend images share the same digest after promotion

- **WHEN** comparing `gcloud artifacts docker images describe asia-northeast2-docker.pkg.dev/liverty-music-dev/backend/<image-name>:<sha>` against `gcloud artifacts docker images describe asia-northeast2-docker.pkg.dev/liverty-music-prod/backend/<image-name>:vX.Y.Z` after a release event for that SHA, for any `<image-name>` in `{server, consumer, concert-discovery, artist-image-sync}`
- **THEN** the `image_summary.digest` field SHALL be identical between the two outputs

#### Scenario: Release CI SHALL refuse a matrix entry if its dev AR :<sha> is missing

- **WHEN** a GitHub Release is published with a `github.sha` for which `asia-northeast2-docker.pkg.dev/liverty-music-dev/backend/<image-name>:<sha>` does not yet exist for any matrix entry (e.g., release cut on a non-main commit, or the dev build for that specific matrix image failed)
- **THEN** the affected matrix entry SHALL fail at the digest-resolve step with an explicit error referencing the recovery runbook section
- **AND** the affected matrix entry SHALL NOT publish any tag to prod AR for `<image-name>`
- **AND** the digest-resolve step SHALL retry up to 5 additional times after the initial attempt (6 total attempts) with 60-second waits between attempts, for a maximum total wait of approximately 5 minutes — to absorb the race window where a release is cut seconds after a push and the dev build is still in-flight
- **AND** other matrix entries SHALL NOT be cancelled by a single failing entry — `strategy.fail-fast: false` SHALL be set so partial-success recovery (per the runbook) is possible

#### Scenario: Prod build uses prod environment Workload Identity

- **WHEN** the prod retag path runs (in any matrix entry)
- **THEN** GitHub Actions SHALL authenticate via the `prod` environment's Workload Identity Provider (`projects/108947861615/.../github-provider` and `github-actions@liverty-music-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)

### Requirement: CI service accounts MAY hold scoped cross-project AR reader for image promotion

The `github-actions@liverty-music-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com` service account MAY hold `roles/artifactregistry.reader` on `liverty-music-dev` Artifact Registry repositories, bound at the **repository resource level** (not the project level), for the sole purpose of resolving and copying image digests during release-triggered prod promotion. The binding SHALL be declared in Pulumi and SHALL be limited to repositories whose images participate in the dev → prod retag flow. The grant is structurally distinct from cluster-SA cross-project grants (forbidden above) because CI service accounts are ephemeral Workflow-run identities scoped via Workload Identity Federation to a specific GitHub repo, with no persistent runtime presence in any cluster.

> **Scope of this modification**:
> - **REMOVES** the "Backend dev AR is NOT yet granted (forward-looking)" scenario — the gap it documented is now closed by this change's tasks §1.
> - **ADDS** the positive-presence scenario "Prod CI SA holds repo-scoped reader on dev backend AR".
> - **UPDATES** the "Prod CI SA holds NO writer or admin on dev AR" scenario: canonical asserted only against `frontend`; the delta generalises to iterate `<repo>` over `{frontend, backend}` so the no-writer/admin invariant covers both grants. Same intent, broader assertion surface.
> - **UNCHANGED**: requirement body, the "Prod CI SA holds repo-scoped reader on dev frontend AR" scenario, and the "Prod CI SA holds NO project-level reader on dev project" scenario.

#### Scenario: Prod CI SA holds repo-scoped reader on dev frontend AR

- **WHEN** running `gcloud artifacts repositories get-iam-policy frontend --project=liverty-music-dev --location=asia-northeast2 --flatten='bindings[].members' --filter='bindings.members~github-actions@liverty-music-prod'`
- **THEN** the output SHALL contain a binding for `roles/artifactregistry.reader`
- **AND** the binding SHALL be at the repository resource level (not project IAM)

#### Scenario: Prod CI SA holds repo-scoped reader on dev backend AR

- **WHEN** running `gcloud artifacts repositories get-iam-policy backend --project=liverty-music-dev --location=asia-northeast2 --flatten='bindings[].members' --filter='bindings.members~github-actions@liverty-music-prod'`
- **THEN** the output SHALL contain a binding for `roles/artifactregistry.reader`
- **AND** the binding SHALL be at the repository resource level (not project IAM)

#### Scenario: Prod CI SA holds NO writer or admin on dev AR

- **WHEN** running `gcloud artifacts repositories get-iam-policy <repo> --project=liverty-music-dev --location=asia-northeast2 --flatten='bindings[].members' --filter='bindings.members~github-actions@liverty-music-prod'` for each of `frontend` and `backend`
- **THEN** the output SHALL NOT contain `roles/artifactregistry.writer`, `roles/artifactregistry.repoAdmin`, or `roles/artifactregistry.admin`

#### Scenario: Prod CI SA holds NO project-level reader on dev project

- **WHEN** running `gcloud projects get-iam-policy liverty-music-dev --flatten='bindings[].members' --filter='bindings.members~github-actions@liverty-music-prod'`
- **THEN** the result SHALL be empty (the grants live at the repo level, not the project level)
