## Purpose

This capability defines the loading sequence experience displayed during data aggregation for new users who have completed artist discovery in the onboarding flow. The loading sequence provides an engaging, multi-phase animated experience that maintains user engagement during the 3-10 second processing time required to search for live event data across followed artists.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Progressive Loading Animation
The system SHALL display a multi-phase animated loading sequence during data aggregation, replacing a simple spinner.

#### Scenario: Phase 1 display (0-2 seconds)
- **WHEN** the loading sequence begins
- **THEN** the system SHALL display the message "あなたのMusic DNAを構築中..."
- **AND** the message SHALL appear with a fade-in animation

#### Scenario: Phase 2 display (2-5 seconds)
- **WHEN** 2 seconds have elapsed since the loading sequence began
- **THEN** the system SHALL transition to display the message "全国のライブスケジュールと照合中..."
- **AND** the transition SHALL use a smooth crossfade animation

#### Scenario: Phase 3 display (5+ seconds)
- **WHEN** 5 seconds have elapsed since the loading sequence began
- **THEN** the system SHALL transition to display the message "AIが最新のツアー情報を検索中... 🤖"

---

### Requirement: Minimum Display Duration
The system SHALL enforce a minimum 3-second display time for the loading sequence regardless of data loading speed.

#### Scenario: Fast data load
- **WHEN** all data aggregation completes in under 3 seconds
- **THEN** the system SHALL continue displaying the loading animation until 3 seconds have elapsed
- **AND** the system SHALL then navigate to the Dashboard

#### Scenario: Normal data load
- **WHEN** data aggregation completes after 3 or more seconds
- **THEN** the system SHALL navigate to the Dashboard immediately upon completion

---

### Requirement: Data Aggregation Orchestration
The system SHALL trigger `SearchNewConcerts` for each followed artist in parallel during the loading sequence.

#### Scenario: Successful aggregation for all artists
- **WHEN** the loading sequence starts
- **THEN** the system SHALL call `ListFollowedArtists` to retrieve the user's followed artists
- **AND** the system SHALL call `SearchNewConcerts` for each followed artist in parallel
- **AND** upon all searches completing, the system SHALL navigate to the Dashboard

#### Scenario: Partial failure
- **WHEN** `SearchNewConcerts` fails for one or more artists
- **THEN** the system SHALL proceed with successfully retrieved data
- **AND** the system SHALL NOT block navigation due to individual artist failures

#### Scenario: Initial artist list retrieval failure
- **WHEN** the loading sequence starts
- **AND** the `ListFollowedArtists` RPC fails after retries
- **THEN** the system SHALL navigate to the Dashboard
- **AND** the system SHALL NOT display an infinite loading state

---

### Requirement: Global Timeout
The system SHALL enforce a 10-second global timeout on data aggregation to prevent infinite loading states.

#### Scenario: Timeout fires
- **WHEN** 10 seconds have elapsed and data aggregation has not completed
- **THEN** the system SHALL abort all remaining search requests
- **AND** the system SHALL navigate to the Dashboard with only the successfully retrieved data
- **AND** the system SHALL NOT display an error message

---

### Requirement: Navigation Guard
The system SHALL prevent direct access to the loading sequence route.

#### Scenario: Direct URL access while unauthenticated
- **WHEN** an unauthenticated user navigates directly to `/onboarding/loading`
- **THEN** the system SHALL redirect to the Landing Page (`/`)

#### Scenario: Direct URL access while authenticated with completed onboarding
- **WHEN** an authenticated user with ≥1 followed artist navigates directly to `/onboarding/loading`
- **THEN** the system SHALL redirect to the Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

#### Scenario: Direct URL access while authenticated without followed artists
- **WHEN** an authenticated user with no followed artists navigates directly to `/onboarding/loading`
- **THEN** the system SHALL redirect to the Artist Discovery page (`/onboarding/discover`)
